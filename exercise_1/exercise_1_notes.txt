Interesting observations I had during this exercise:

- If an integer is divisible by 3 && 5, it's also divisible by 15. So I could use '%15' instead of the AND operator to satisfy this condition. Though I still used the AND operator to practice implementing logic operations.  

- In order to successfully compile the 'main' func, I had to list the conditionals in a logical order (3 && 5 -> 3 -> 5). 3 && 5 must be the first condition because if the compiler checks '%3' or '%5' before '3%%5', it'll just assign 'fizz' or 'buzz' to a value that should print 'fizzbuzz' (15, 30, 45).     

- (printFizzbuzz) I can use void data types for all of my FizzBuzz funcs since they don't return a value.
